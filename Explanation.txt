Pair<String, Pair<String,String>> p4 = new Pair<String, Pair<String, String>>("very", new Pair<String, String>("strange", "stuff") );

This line creates a Pair reference variable p4, with Pair member types of String for the first element, and Pair for the second element, which
in itself has two String members for the first and second elements.  Then the line calls the Pair constructor, creating a new pair with the first
element being "very" and the second element being a pair, which that pair is being created by calling the Pair constructor with two strings
"strange" and "stuff".  P4 is set to point at this new Pair created by these constructors.
